# ML-automation

This presentation describes high-level architecture of real-time Machine Learning automation.
The system allows :
* collect real-time events from different devices (IoT devices, machines, etc)
* apply previously developed ML models to the data (make prdictions)
* react on them (send notifications or managing commands to machines)
* store incoming data in Data Lake for further analysis or trainig
* train new ML models or make predictions on off-line data
* analyse data using traditional reporting tools
